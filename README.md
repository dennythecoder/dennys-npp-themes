# Notepad++ Themes

This is a collection of Notepad++ themes.  To get started _without git_:

1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/dennythecoder/dennys-npp-themes/archive/master.zip).

2. Extract the files

3. Place the themes folder into the appropriate folder (don't copy over any existing themes):
-  For installed instances, place in `%appdata%\Notepad++` folder
-  For standalone instances, place at the root (i.e. C:\npp.7.x.x.bin\) 

I've procured these from other locations.  If you'd like to make changes to any of them, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.  I'd like to add more.

## Todo
